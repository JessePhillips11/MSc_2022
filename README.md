### Defining Extreme Thermal Fluctuations
This project aims to create an objective statistical definition of extreme thermal fluctuations in the marine environment. An extension to the `detect_event()` function within the [heatwaveR package](https://github.com/robwschlegel/heatwaveR) (Schlegel and Smit, 2018) will be written in order to detect these extreme events around the world using R.
